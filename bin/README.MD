This is RGGE (Pronounced Redge) a Java game engine that is fully open source that was created for a project in my SDD class.
While currently being simplistic I hope to later increase the power later on.
What it can do:
	Draw squares of different colours and sizes in different positions
	Process input, logic and rendering.
What can't it do:
	Anything not involving squares
	Anything not involving solid colours
	Anything involving shaders
	Event based coding
Will these be added? Yes, just later.

Since they will only accept actual programs and not things like engines I've decided to make a snake style game to prove it's power.
